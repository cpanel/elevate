# Troubleshooting and frequently asked questions

This document provides answers to frequently asked questions and solutions for some common troubleshooting issues.

If you need more help, you can [open a ticket](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/technical-support-services/how-to-open-a-technical-support-ticket/).

## Frequently asked questions

### How do I check the current status of the process?

Run the following command to check the current status of the ELevate process:

```
/scripts/elevate-cpanel --status
```

### Where are the current stage and status stored?

They are stored in the `/var/cpanel/elevate` JSON file as values for the
`stage_number` and `status` keys.

During execution the  `stage_number` key is set to `1` through `5`. When the process completes, the `stage_number` key is set to `6`.

The possible values for `status` key are:

* `running`
* `paused`
* `success`
* `failed`

### Where is the ELevate log file?

You can view the main log from the `/scripts/elevate-cpanel` script with the following command:

```
/scripts/elevate-cpanel --log
```

### Where are Leapp issues logged?

Logs for the Leapp process are located in the following files:  

* `/var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt`
* `/var/log/leapp/leapp-report.json`


### How do I continue the ELevate process if it stops?

Address any reported issues, then continue the existing process with the following command:

```
/scripts/elevate-cpanel --continue
```

## Troubleshooting

### The ELevate process is locked on stage 1

If the ELevate process is locked on `stage 1` and the process appears to be looping, run the following command to unlock the process:

```
   /scripts/elevate-cpanel --start
```

You can also unlock the process with the following steps:

1. Clear the previous stage with the following command. Do **not** use this option if the process is past Stage 2.

  ```
   /scripts/elevate-cpanel --clean
  ````

2. Restart the ELevate process:
  ```
   /scripts/elevate-cpanel --start
  ```

### The CCS service will not start after ELevate succeeds

This error can occur if the schema failed to update.  

Perform the following steps to correct this error:

**NOTE:** Only remove or reinstall `cpanel-z-push` if it was installed prior to running
ELevate or it is currently installed.  

#### Check the status of the package

Run the following command to check the status of the package:

  RHEL-based systems:
  ```
  rpm -q cpanel-z-push
  ```

  UbuntuÂ®-based systems:
  ```
  apt list --installed | grep cpanel-z-push
  ```

#### Remove and reinstall the CCS service

Perform the following steps to remove and reinstall the CCS service:

1.  Remove the package:

  RHEL-based systems:
  ```
  dnf -y remove cpanel-ccs-calendarserver cpanel-z-push
  ```

  Ubuntu-based systems:
  ```
  apt -y purge cpanel-ccs-calendarserver cpanel-z-push
  ```

2.  Remove the `cpanel-ccs` user's home directory

  ```
  rm -rf /opt/cpanel-ccs/
  ```

3.  Install the package(s)

  RHEL-based-systems:
  ```
  dnf -y install cpanel-ccs-calendarserver cpanel-z-push
  ```

  Ubuntu-based systems:
  ```
  apt -y install cpanel-ccs-calendarserver cpanel-z-push
  ```

4.  Clear the `queueprocd` task queue

  ```
  /usr/local/cpanel/bin/servers_queue run
  ```

5.  Verify that the `cpanel-ccs` service is running with the following command:

  ```
  /scripts/restartsrv_cpanel_ccs --status
  ```

  The output will resemble the following example if the service is running:

  ```
  cpanel-ccs (CalendarServer 9.3+fbd0e11675cc0f64a425581b5c8398cc1e09cb6a [Combined] ) is running as cpanel-ccs with PID 1865839 (systemd+/proc check method)
  ```

6.  Import the CCS data.


### The CCS data failed to import during elevate

This data is exported to the `/var/cpanel/elevate_ccs_export/` directory during the ELevate process.

Run the following command as the `root` user to import the data for **every** user:

```
/usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/bin/perl -MCpanel::Config::Users -e 'require "/var/cpanel/perl5/lib/CCSHooks.pm"; my @users = Cpanel::Config::Users::getcpusers(); foreach my $user (@users) { my $import_data = { user => $user, extract_dir => "/var/cpanel/elevate_ccs_export/$user", }; CCSHooks::pkgacct_restore( undef, $import_data ); }'
```

To import a **single** user run the following command, where `CPTEST` represents the username:

```
/usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/bin/perl -e 'require "/var/cpanel/perl5/lib/CCSHooks.pm"; my $import_data = { user => "CPTEST", extract_dir => "/var/cpanel/elevate_ccs_export/CPTEST", }; CCSHooks::pkgacct_restore( undef, $import_data );'
```
