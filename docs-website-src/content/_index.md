# Welcome to the cPanel® ELevate project

The ELevate project aims to upgrade a cPanel installation with minimal outages. It builds and expands on the [AlmaLinux OS ELevate](https://wiki.almalinux.org/elevate/ELevate-quickstart-guide.html) project, which was created for in-place upgrades of Red Hat®-based systems.

[Pull requests are welcome](https://github.com/cpanel/elevate/pulls). Code contributions are subject to our [Contributor License Agreement](docs/cPanel-CLA.pdf).

## The cPanel ELevate project

This project will perform the following upgrades:

* CentOS 7 to AlmaLinux 8
* CloudLinux™ 7 to CloudLinux 8
* Ubuntu® 20 to Ubuntu 22

cPanel ELevate provides a wrapper around existing upgrade projects. While these projects are very effective at upgrading distribution packages, if you attempt to use them directly on a cPanel installation, your system will no longer function correctly.

The cPanel ELevate script wraps the following projects:
 * RHEL-based systems: The [Leapp Project](https://leapp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
 * Ubuntu-based systems: The [do-release-upgrade](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/server/how-to/software/upgrade-your-release/) script.

For more information about the project, you can watch the cPanel ELevate walkthrough. [![cPanel ELevate walkthrough video](elevate-video.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag9-RneFqmc).

### The ELevate process

The cPanel ELevate project [checks for any blockers](https://cpanel.github.io/elevate/blockers/) before it starts the upgrade process. The process is performed in stages. The server reboots between each stage and then does a final reboot when the process is complete.

#### Stage 1

Install the `elevate-cpanel` service.

#### Stage 2

Update the system's distribution packages, disable any cPanel services, and set the message-of-the-day (motd) to inform users an upgrade is in process.

#### Stage 3

Configure the ELevate repository.

Update cPanel packages, remove any conflicting packages, then back up the existing configuration.

**NOTE:** The backup does **not** include any of the system's data. However, it might include the configuration data for the following software:
  * cPanel (`upcp`)
  * EasyApache 4
  * MySQL or MariaDB
  * Distribution Perl/PECL binary reinstalls

The system may ask you to provide answers to some questions before it can start the upgrade process.

#### Stage 4

Upgrade the server to the new distribution and restore the removed packages.  

#### Stage 5

Verify the installation and clean up the server. This includes removing the `elevate-cpanel` service.

To start the ELevate process and upgrade your server, read our [ELevate Your Server](https://cpanel.github.io/elevate/getting-started/) documentation.
