# Known Blockers

The following is a list of install states which the script will intentionally prevent you from upgrading with. This is because the script cannot garantuee a successful upgrade with these conditions in place.

## Basic checks

The following conditions are assumed to be in place any time you run this script:

* You have **CentOS 7.9** or greater installed.
  * We DO NOT support alternative RHEL 7 (including CloudLinux) variants.
* You are logged in as **root**.

## Disk space

At any given time, the upgrade process may use at or more than 3 GB. If you have a complex mount system, we have determined that the following areas may require disk space for a period of time:

* **/boot**: 120 MB
* **/usr/local/cpanel**: 1.5 GB
* **/var/lib**: 3 GB

## Unsupported software

The following software is known to lead to a corrupt install if this script is used. We block elevation when it is detected:

* cPanel CCS Calendar Server - Requires Postgresql < 10.0
* Postgresql - Elevate upgrades you to Postgresql 10.x which makes it impossible to downgrade to a 9.x Postgresql.

## Things you need to upgrade first.

* **nameserver**: cPanel provides support for a myriad of nameservers. (MyDNS, nsd, bind, powerdns). On AlmaLinux 8, it is preferred that you always be on PowerDNS.
  * Mitigation: `/scripts/setupnameserver powerdns`
* **MySQL**: 99% of existing AlmaLinux 8 cPanel installs end up with MySQL 8. We recommend you upgrade your MySQL to 8.0 if possible.
  * **MariaDB**: If you have already switched to MariaDB, you have no way of reaching MySQL. Be sure you are on 10.3 or better before moving to AlmaLinux 8.
