        The following command failed to execute successfully on your server:

        $bin -a

        The following message was given as the reason for the failure:

        $stderr

        Since this script will need to reboot your server, we need to ensure a
        consistent file system in between in each reboot.  Please review the
        entries in '/etc/fstab' and ensure that each entry is valid and that
        '$bin -a' returns exit code 0 before continuing.

        If your '/etc/fstab' file has not been customized, you may want to
        consider reaching out to cPanel Support for assistance:
