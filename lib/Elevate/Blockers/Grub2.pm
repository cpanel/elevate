        $deb/grub.cfg is currently a symlink to $rhel/grub.cfg. Your provider
        may have added this to support booting your server using their own
        instance of the GRUB2 bootloader, one which looks for its
        configuration, boot entries, and modules in a different location from
        where your operating system stores this data. In order to allow the
        process to complete successfully, the upgrade process will rename the
        current $deb directory, re-create $deb as a symlink to $rhel,
        and then copy as much of the old $deb into $rhel as possible.

        The configuration of the GRUB2 bootloader does not match the
        expectations of this script. For more information, see the output of
        the script when run at the console:

        /scripts/elevate-cpanel --check

        If your GRUB2 configuration has not been customized, you may want
        to consider reaching out to cPanel Support for assistance:

    Disabling the BLS boot entry format prevents the resulting system from
    adding kernel updates to any boot loader configuration, because the old
    utility responsible for maintaining native GRUB2 boot loader entries was
    removed and replaced with a wrapper around the new utility, which only
    understands BLS format. This means that the old kernel will be used on
    reboot, unless the GRUB2 configuration file is manually edited to load the
    new kernel. Furthermore, after a few kernel updates, the DNF package
    manager may begin to remove old kernels, including the one still used in
    the configuration file. If that happens, the system will fail to come back
    after a subsequent reboot.

    The safe option is to remove the following line in /etc/default/grub:

    GRUB_ENABLE_BLSCFG=false

    or to change it so that it is set to "true" instead.

    The grub2-pc package is not installed. The GRUB2 boot loader is
    required to upgrade via leapp.
