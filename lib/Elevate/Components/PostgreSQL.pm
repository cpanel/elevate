=head1 NAME

Elevate::Components::PostgreSQL

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Upgrades the system PostgreSQL instance.

This is considered to be a best-effort task: if something fails in an expected
way, it will emit errors and notify the user but will B<not> terminate the
ELevate process or otherwise cause it to be considered an overall failure.

=head2 check

noop

=head2 pre_distro_upgrade

1. Store PG encoding and locale
2. Disable PG service
3. Backup PG datadir

=head2 post_distro_upgrade

1. Update PG config file to workaround bad directive
2. Perform PG upgrade
3. Reenable PG service
4. Update PG config for cPanel

=item _disable_postgresql_service

Touches the file needed to get Service Manager to believe that PostgreSQL is
disabled. If the service is enabled, then upcp fails during the post-leapp
phase of the RpmDB component. Also doubles as the mechanism by which PostgreSQL
is disabled on a system where a step prior to the upgrade fails.

=item _perform_config_workaround

There is a bug with the EL8 postgresql-upgrade package, namely that the support
for the C<unix_socket_directories> configuration directive which was
back-ported from 9.3 into the 9.2 package for EL7 is not being applied to the
version of 9.2 being built to support the upgrade. For this reason, we need to
alter the existing F<postgresql.conf> file to comment out any
C<unix_socket_directories> directives and add a standard
C<unix_socket_directory> directive at the end instead.
