MySQL Governor will leave the repo files for MySQL/MariaDB versions provided by
cPanel.  Since the repo files are owned by a package and it is not necessary for
them to be installed in order to reinstall cPanel MySQL/MariaDB, it is safe to
remove them.  CL leapp will inhibit based on these files being in place, so it
is also necessary to remove them.
