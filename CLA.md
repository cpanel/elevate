# CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT

You agree that your present and future Contributions (defined below) to cPanel, L.L.C. ("++cPanel++,"" "++us++," or "++we++"), will be governed by these terms (this " **CLA** "). Except for the license granted in this Agreement to
cPanel and Recipients (defined below), you reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Contributions.

**1. ++Definitions.++**

"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is submitted by you to cPanel for inclusion in, or documentation of, a Project or any of the software or products owned or managed by cPanel ("++Work++"). For purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to cPanel or its representatives, including but not limited to communication or electronic mailing lists, source code control systems and repositories, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, cPanel for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by you as "Not a Contribution."

"++Project++" means any of the projects owned or managed by cPanel in which software is offered under a license set out in Exhibit A.

"++You++" (or "++Your++") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is entering into this Agreement with cPanel. For purposes of this definition, "legal entity" shall include the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity.

**2. ++Your Contribution++**. You must agree to the terms of this CLA before making a Contribution. You should not make any Contributions if you disagree with this CLA, and by making any Contribution you agree that this CLA shall govern any and all Contributions made by you.

**3. ++Originality of Work++**. You represent that each of your Contributions is entirely your original work. You may not attempt to make a Contribution of any material which is not your original work. Should you wish to submit work that is not your original creation, you may submit it to cPanel separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third party: [named here]."

**4. ++Your Employer++**. References to "employer" in this Agreement include your employer or anyone else for whom you are acting in making your Contribution, e.g. as a contractor, vendor, or agent. If your Contribution is made in the course of your work for an employer or your employer has intellectual property rights in your Contribution by contract or applicable law, you must secure written permission from your employer to make the Contribution before accepting this CLA and provide such written permission to us, and receive our agreement prior to making a Contribution. In such case, the term "you" in this Agreement will refer to you and the employer collectively. If you change employers in the future and desire to make Contributions for the new employer, then you agree to notify us and to secure permission from the new employer and from us before making such Contributions.

**5. ++Licenses++**.

(a) _Copyright License_. You grant to cPanel and to any person or entity who receives your Contribution from or through cPanel or a Project (by any means whatsoever) (such persons or entities "++Recipients++"), a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable right and license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions and any derivative works thereof, and to sublicense any or all of the foregoing rights to third parties. This includes, at our option, the right to sublicense these same rights to third parties through multiple levels of sublicensees or other licensing arrangements. You agree that we can do all things in relation to your Contribution as if we were the sole owner, and if we make a derivative work of your Contribution, then we will be the sole owner of that derivative work. While your Contribution may be made using a particular license, we may, at our discretion, incorporate the Contribution into our proprietary license. You agree that you will not assert any moral rights in your Contribution against us, our licensees, assignees, or transferees. You agree that we have no duty to consult with, obtain the consent of, or pay or render an accounting to you for any use or distribution of your Contribution.

(b) _Patent License_. You grant to cPanel and Recipients, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer
to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution alone or by combination of your Contribution with the Work.

**6. ++Representations and Warranties++**. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above right and licenses. You represent that you have secured permission from your employer as required by Section 5. If you are accepting this Agreement on behalf of your employer or any entity, you represent and warrant that you have the necessary actual authority to bind such employer or entity to the obligations contained in this Agreement. UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, AND EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY STATED IN SECTIONS 3 , 4 , AND 6 , THE CONTRIBUTION PROVIDED PURSUANT TO THIS CLA IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You represent and warrant that: (a) each Submission is and shall be an original work of authorship and you can legally grant the rights set out in this CLA; (b) to the best of your knowledge, each Contribution does not and will not violate any third party’s copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property rights; and (c) each Contribution complies with all applicable laws.

**7. Information about Submissions**. You agree that Contributions and information about Contributions may be maintained indefinitely and disclosed publicly, including your name and other information that you submit with your Contribution.

**8. Governing Law/Jurisdiction**. This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas without regard to the conflicts of laws principles thereof. Any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with the Agreement shall be finally settled and exclusively by the state or federal courts sitting in Harris County, Texas. For purposes of this Agreement, the parties hereby irrevocably consent to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the federal and state courts in Harris County, Texas.

**9. Entire Agreement/Assignment**. This agreement may be assigned by cPanel, it may not be assigned by you (by operation of law or otherwise). This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the corporate successors and permitted assigns of the parties.

**10. Agree to Notify of Change of Circumstances**. You agree to notify cPanel of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect. Email us at legal@cpanel.net.
